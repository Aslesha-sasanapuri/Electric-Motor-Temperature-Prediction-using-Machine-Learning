# Electric-Motor-Temperature-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
The goal of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model that can predict the motor temperature based on sensor data such as:
Voltage
Current
Speed
Torque
Ambient temperature
The system helps operators monitor motor health and increases reliability and safety.
